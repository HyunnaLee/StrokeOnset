# StrokeOnset

This repo. provides the MATLAB codes for "Machine Learning Apploach to Identify Stroke Within 4.5 Hours." This includes the following steps:

1) Infarct segmentation, 
2) Ratio map generation (and registration),
3) Texture feature extraction,
4) Training machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest)
5) Test the trained models.

# Requrements

This code is optimized on MATLAB R2018a and requres other libraries as follows:
